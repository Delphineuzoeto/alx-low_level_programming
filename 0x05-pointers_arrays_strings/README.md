C - Pointers, arrays and strings

The objectives of this program are: 
 1. What are pointers and how to use them
 2. What are arrays and how to use them
 3. What are the differences between pointers and arrays
 4. How to use strings and how to manipulate them
Scope of variables

Requirements
a. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
b. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
c. All your files should end with a new line
d. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
e. The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h


Tasks:
1. Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);
2. Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);
3. Write a function that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

4. Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
5. Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
6. Write a function that reverses a string.
7. Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
8. Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
9. Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
10. Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest
