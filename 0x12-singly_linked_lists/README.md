Introduction


Singly linked lists are an essential data structure commonly used in computer programming. They provide efficient insertion and deletion operations, making them suitable for scenarios where frequent dynamic data updates are required. Each element in a singly linked list is called a "node" and consists of two parts: the data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

This C implementation of singly linked lists serves as a starting point for learning and understanding the fundamentals of linked list data structures.

Features

Insertion of elements at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.

Deletion of elements from the beginning, end, or a specific position in the list.

Traversal of the linked list to display its contents.

Finding the length of the linked list.

Checking if the list is empty.

Memory management, including freeing the memory occupied by the list.

Getting started:

1. Create a directory

2. cd into the directory.

3.Compile the sourse code using gcc -o main main.c filename

4. Run the executable using your main.c file


Then repeat themethod for the other tasks.
